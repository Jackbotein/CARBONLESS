        <h3><b>Climate change is an existential threat to humanity.</b></h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>In America, our government has failed to act on climate change. Dirty industry lobbying has prevented federal climate action, meaning that individual emissions reductions are critical. Jack Botein founded Carbonless Living in the summer of 2020 to enable environmentally conscious individuals to fully eliminate their residential carbon emmisions by renting carbon neutral apartments. The apartment buildings on our platform do this by installing solar panels and purchasing carbon offset credits (ex. a forest preserve sequesters one ton of carbon dioxide, sells us the right to emit one ton of carbon). According to the National Academy of Sciences, twenty percent of American greenhouse gas emissions are created by heating, cooling and powering households (this is huge). By renting your next apartment from Carbonless, you can eliminate your entire residential carbon footprint.</h3>
<br>
        <h3><b>Our mission is to make it easy for people to find carbon neutral apartment rentals.</b></h3>
